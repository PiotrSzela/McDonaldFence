# McDonaldFence

The program was created as a part of a recruitment task.

The program gets from the user length of his fence and calculates the optimal area of the farm (square).
The program takes into account that there is no need to put a fence on one side of the farm.

I started coding to learn something new. I want to change my current job and start doing something more interesting.
I have got a lot of free time and I hope it can help me to learn coding fast :blush:
